        <h2>Cheesecake</h2>
        <h4>Procedure: <br/>
            Finely crush 100g of biscuits and then add 40g of melted butter. Mix well. <br/>
            Gently press it into the pan and then place into refrigerator. <br/>
            Soak 5g of gelatin with 25mL or water for 15min. For a firmer cheesecake use 6g. 
            Plop 200g of room temperature cream cheese into a bowl and start mashing it. Once it’s soft add 100g of unsweetened yogurt. Then add 65g of sugar. <br/> 
            Pour hot water into a bowl and place the smaller bowl with the gelatin into the bowl of hot water. <br/>
            Mix the gelatin until it melts and then add it to the cheesecake batter and mix. <br/>
            Pour 200g if whipping cream into a bowl. Whisk it until it is 70-80% fluffy, do not over whisk. <br/>
            Pour immediately into the batter after the husking. Use a spatula to fold it into the batter. <br/>
            Divide the batter into 2 equal parts, pouring the first half into the mold/pan. <br/>
            Spread evenly and put it back into fridge/freezer to set, 20 minutes. <br/>
            Next week 20mL of hot milk to 7g of matcha powder, mixing well, then set aside to cool. Once cooked, add it to the cheesecake batter from earlier. Fold it quickly and gently and do not mix it wildly. Take the set cheesecake out and add the matcha batter on top. Put the entire thing back into the fridge for 3-4 hours to set. <br/> 
            To take the cake out use a wrung out hot towel to press the sides of it for 20-30 sec.</h4>
